| April 5  |    9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| March 5  | 2:30 - 3:00  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Thinking with Benjamin on how to find the candidates for the misspelled word. |
| March 7  | 12:55 - 1:45 |                                                                                                           Once again, I was working with Benjamin on how to find the candidates for the misspelled word. Eventually, we decided on a way to do this. This method involves going through each letter in the mispelled word and either substituing it, adding another letter, or deleting it and checking to see if any of the changes matches a word in the dictionary. |
| March 14 | 9:00 - 9:55  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Working on Tabulation approach to find the edit distance between 2 words. I spent this time understanding the theory and trying to writing it into code. Right now I am trying to find the min value based on all of the cases. |
| March 16 | 3:30 - 4:30  | I think I finished Tabulation. I added all of the cases (like if the heads are the same) and all of the other cases (if the heads are not the same, ex: a and tail b). Additionally, I used Math.min to find the smallest of the cases and then added the minimum value to our current spot on the table. At the end of the lev method, I return the value all the way on the bottom right of the corney. I believe this works. However, I am not sure how to test it. |
| March 17 | 2:00 - 3:00  |                                                                                                                                                             Just working on how to test my tabulation. I basically just created a for loop that goes through each word in the dictionary and ran the lev function to get the edit distance with the typed word. At the end, I check if the edit distance is less or equal to the threshold. I haven't tested this yet. |
| March 17 | 9:40 - 10:20 |                                                                                      In my testing, I just added at the end where I turn the arraylist into an array. I tested my algorithm and I saw that it didn't work. I realized that for one of my cases I forgot to do j - 1. I think that solved the problem. The thing I am very confused about is that I have the correct words but Im still getting it wrong because the position of my words in the array. |
