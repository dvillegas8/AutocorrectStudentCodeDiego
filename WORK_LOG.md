Eventually, we decided on a way to do this. This method involves going through each letter in the mispelled word and either substituing it, adding another letter, or deleting it and checking to see if any of the changes matches a word in the dictionary. |

I spent this time understanding the theory and trying to writing it into code. Right now I am trying to find the min value based on all of the cases. |
| March 16 |  3:30 - 4:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I think I finished Tabulation. I added all of the cases (like if the heads are the same) and all of the other cases (if the heads are not the same, ex: a and tail b). Additionally, I used Math.min to find the smallest of the cases and then added the minimum value to our current spot on the table. At the end of the lev method, I return the value all the way on the bottom right of the corney. I believe this works. However, I am not sure how to test it. |

I basically just created a for loop that goes through each word in the dictionary and ran the lev function to get the edit distance with the typed word. At the end, I check if the edit distance is less or equal to the threshold. I haven't tested this yet. |

I tested my algorithm and I saw that it didn't work. I realized that for one of my cases I forgot to do j - 1. I think that solved the problem. The thing I am very confused about is that I have the correct words but Im still getting it wrong because the position of my words in the array. |

After talking to Caden, I realized that I needed to sort the words by edit distance & alphabetical order. And so, I began working on that part but I am honestly really not sure how to do this. |
| March 19 |  8:30 - 9:20  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Figuring out how to sort the array. I just decided to use a type of bubble sort and compare the edit distance and the words lexigraphically. I'm not sure if this works but I think there still needs to be a few new fixes. |
| March 21 | 10:55 - 11:55 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Finished the edit distance algorithm. I figured out how to test it out and I realized that I was also indexing into the wrong array. After fixing everything, I passed all of the test cases. I am not working on finding candidate words. The first thing I thought of is using a Trie in order to quickly lookup words in the dictionary. Therefore, I am currently trying to set that up |
| March 22 |  4:00 - 5:10  | I didn't do any coding during this time. Instead, I tried finding ways in order to reduce my dictionary into a list of candidate words. The first thing that came to mind was first checking if the "misspelled" word is actually in the dictionary. Second, I wanted to compare the lengths of words in the dictionary to the misspelled word. I will have some sort of threshhold where I only have words that are 2 characters away in length from the misspelled word. This is because if I have an 8 letter word there is no way I will suggest correcting it to a 3 letter word. Third, I was thinking of seperating words into different parts and then comparing them to words in the dictionary. However, I am not sure how I will achieve this. |
